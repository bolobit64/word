This program uses classification to define 'things' of the world.

Scope Statement
  The scope of this project is to define everything in the real world into a classification code. Thus, linking the real world with the virtual world. The parameters are currently starting from the smallest piece and working our way up while not using theory but only what has been proven(stay in the bounds of reality as we currently know it). I want to develop this project as an open-source code that anyone can use, including machines, to define not only the object itself but how it interacts with other things and where it fits in the classification system. 
  
Objectives
  I plan to start from the smallest part I know about... the atom. Yes, I know it has been proven that there are smaller particles that make up the parts of the atom. If someone would like to define thoughs parts than I am willing to add them! I feel more confident starting with an atom and working my way up then filling in the blanks. 
  From the atom, I will work my way up classifying as much as possible. Once again, this is open-source and it will only grow as fast as the programmers program. So let's get started!
Resources
  I am currently running solo on this project and will gladly produce a list of names that worked on this project. We, the people, are the current resource. I would like to create a crawler that searches a websites like wikipedia then creates a stardardizes template to take some of the monotonous work out of programming. That way, not only are we working on it but also bots!
  
Risks
  I can see this getting quickly out of hand and may task some of the programmers who are active in the code to manage and maintain the code when I can not. Crawlers mey also be a risk and also getting shutdown for some reason(corporate legal bullcrap)...
  
Schedules
  First month:define the atom, basics of chemistry, and basics of physics
Evaluation
  This project will be successful if we can classify the different pieces of the world one piece at a time
